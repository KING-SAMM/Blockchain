## DOUBLE SPENDING PROBLEM
------------------------------------------

*Scenario: If Joey uses his 5 BTC in more than one transaction.*

> Spending the same Bitcoin in more than one transaction is called Double Spending Problem.



## ENCOUNTERNG DOUBLE SPENDING IN BLOCKCHAIN
------------------------------------------

The security measure which prevent double spending in Blockchain are as follows:

1. Transaction details are sent to all oe as many nnodes in the network.
2. Blockchain is constantly growing and each peer maintains their own copy of Blockchain (i.e distributed ledger)
3. Blockchain ensures that any modification in the block will lead to recomputing of the subsequent blocks until a consensus is reached
4. Anyone can validate the transactions and and this validation prevents double spendinng.


## PSEUDONYMITY IN BITCOIN
------------------------------------------

> Pseudonymity is the near anonymous state in which users have disguised identities and <br> do not disclose their true identities.

- Bitcoin is a permissionless blockchain where you don't need to set up an account.
- The public and private keys are generated by the wallet.
- The address acts as an identifier or pseudonym of a user's transaction.

Therefore Satoshi Nakamoto recommended that users use a new address for each transaction to avoid the transactions being linked to a common owner.


## BITCOIN ADDRESSES
------------------------------------------

> The Bitcoin address correspondsd to a public key based on ECDSA (Elliptic Curve <br> Digital Signature Algorithm) used in the Bitcoin.

A wallet can have many such addresses and can be used for transactions.


## BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS UTXOs
------------------------------------------

UTXO or Unspent Transaction Output is the fundamental building block of Bitcoin.

*Scenario: Ross wants to send 0.15 BTC to Joey.*

(Before): Ross has a total of 3.21BTC in his wallet distributed in three bytes: 3, 0.2, 0.01 BTCs.

Ross makes the transaction: He destroys the byte containing the 0.2 BTC in order to send 0.15 BTC to Joey.

(After): The remaining 0.05 BTC creates a new output, and is available in Ross' wallet as another byte, thereby reducing his balance to 3.06 BTC.



## BITCOIN TRANSACTION STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------

A Bitcoin transaction has three pieces of information
1. Input:
    - This is a record of which Bitcoin address was used to send the Bitcoin to the receiver in the first place. Also referred to as the unspent trasaction output.
2. Amount:
    - This is the amount of Bitcoins the sender sends to the receiver
3. Output:
    - This is sent to the sender's address as change. It is the new unspent transaction output for his wallet.



## BITCOIN SCRIPT: FEATURES
------------------------------------------

All Bitcoin transaction have scripts embedded into their inputs and outputs.

- Bitcoin Scripts is a stack-based programming language like Forth.
- A list of instructions are recorded with each transaction.
- Opreations in Bitcoin are composed of opcodes. Bitoin scripts have a total of 256 opcodes.
- Bitcoin Script describes how the person can access the Bitcoin if they want to spend them.
- Bitcoin Script is *turin incomplete*.

***NOTE***: Turin incomplete means one cannot have looping conditions in the code. Thus, output from the code is like a boolean: true or false.


## BITCOIN SCRIPT: EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------

*Scenario: Joey verifies the transaction is initiated by Ross.*

- Transaction from Ross is initiated (T<sub>Ross->Joey</sub>)
- Public key of Ross, K<sup>R</sup><sub>pub</sub>, is sent along with the signature, S<sub>R</sub>(T<sub>Ross->Joey</sub>) which Joey can verify.

- Bitcoin transfers scripts instead of signature and the public key.
- Joey can spend Bitcoin only if both the scripts return true after execution.


## BITCOIN SCRIPT: CONSTRUCTION
------------------------------------------

The script consists of a trnsaction input and a transaction output. The two kinds of scripts are called *unlocking script* and *locking script*.

Unlocking script is referred to as *scriptSig* while locking script is referred to as *scriptPubKey*.

Unlocking script is provided by the user to resolve the encumbrance.

The locking script is found in a transaction output, and is the encumbrance that must be fulfilled to spend the output.

The unlocking script consists of the receiver's private key and public key. The locking script is created as follows:

- the receier's public key is duplicated
- a hash is generated for the receiver's public key.
- this hash is compared with the public key hash of the received transaction. 
- the two are compared, and if they are equal, the receiver's private key is used to unlock the transaction. Thus making it available in his wallet.
