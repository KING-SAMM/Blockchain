Bitcoin supply is limited for the currency to have value.

Each block produced contains new vitcoins created from nothing.

The total number of bitcoins have a cap at 21 million. Thus no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.

The rate of block creation is adjusted every 2016 blocks.

At the desired rate of 1 block per 10 mins, 2016 blocks should take exactly 2 weeks to mine. Thus if the last 2016 block have taken more tha 2 weeks. The difficulty is reduced. Consequently, if they took less than 2 weeks, the difficulty is increased.

The number of bitcoins generated per block decreases by 50% every 210,000 blocks.
