BLOCKCHAIN
------------------------------------------
```
Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions (digital records) across a peer-to-peer network. It is a technology that enables Bitcoin and is also applied to many business processes. 

It not only performs transactions but also ensures anonymity and security of its users.

At its core, blockchain is simply a chain of blocks. When using using the words 'block' and 'chain', we are referring to digital information - the block, stored in a public database - the chain

```

HISTORY OF BLOCKCHAIN
------------------------------------------
```
1990 :-         The concept of distributed ledgers has been  around since 1990. The application, Bitorrent, leverages this tech to share media files.
2009 :-         Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and introduced the concept of blockchain which used distributed ledger + advanced cryptography.
2011 - 2012 :-  Cryptocurrency deployment in applications like wallet and exchange platforms.
2012 - 2013 :-  This allwed cryptocurrencies to be used in currency transfers and digital payment systems.
2013 - 2014 :-  Financial markets and applications started using blockchain beyond cash transactions. The evolution of blockchain gave rise to:
2014 - 2015 :-  Evolution of smart contrcts, and:
2015 - 2016 :-  Permissioned Blockchain network solutions.
2016 - 2017 :-  Market development and exploration across industries.

ISSUES IN BANKING SYSTEM
------------------------------------------
```
1. Certain transactions take a long time (even days to complete)
2. High cost of transactions (due to intermediaries, e.g the bank)
3. Account Hacking
4. Net frauds
5. Financial Crisis (This can put your money at risk if it is held by a bank)
6. Every bank maintains its own ledger, thus the banks need to update them independently and reconcile periodically.
```

BLOCKCHAINN SOLUTION FOR THE ISSUES
------------------------------------------
```
1. Transactions are very fast, completeing almost immediately
2. In the banking system, every bank maintains its own ledger, thus the banks need to update them independently and reconcile periodically. The blockchain on the contrary, conprises of a single ledger shared among all participants, thus no separate messaging protocol is required.

Thus, blockchain takled the issues in traditional banking with some of its features mentioned below:

1. Decentralized system
2. Distributed ledger
3. Incentives of validation
4. Concensus Algorithm
5. Advanced Cryptography algorithm
```

BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION PROCESS
------------------------------------------
```
1. New transaction is requested.
2. The reqested ttransaction is broadcasted throughout the network and picked up by various miners who are part of the network
3. Each miner runs some computation in order to validate the transaction.
4. Once validated, the transaction becomes part of the new block created.
5. The new block is, in turn, added to the blockchain.

This is how a new transaction is completed.
```

STEPS OF BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION
------------------------------------------
```
Blockchain transaction works by implementing one of the following features in each step:
1. Cryptography Algorithm
2. Decentralized Network
3. Concensus Mechanism
4. Distributed Ledger
